__Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC)__


Preliminary clinical studies have shown that spiral CT scanning of the lungs can improve early detection of lung cancer in high-risk individuals. Image processing algorithms have the potential to assist in lesion detection on spiral CT studies, and to assess the stability or change in lesion size on serial CT studies. The use of such computer-assisted algorithms could significantly enhance the sensitivity and specificity of spiral CT lung screening, as well as lower costs by reducing physician time needed for interpretation.

The intent of the Lung Imaging Database Consortium (LIDC) initiative was to support a consortium of institutions to develop consensus guidelines for a spiral CT lung image resource and to construct a database of spiral CT lung images. The investigators funded under this initiative created a set of guidelines and metrics for database use and for developing a database as a test-bed and showcase for those methods. The database is available to researchers and users through the Internet and has wide utility as a research, teaching, and training resource.

Specifically, the LIDC initiative aims were to provide:

*	a reference database for the relative evaluation of image processing or CAD algorithms and
*	a flexible query system that will provide investigators the opportunity to evaluate a wide range of technical parameters and de-identified clinical information within this database that may be important for research applications.

This resource will stimulate further database development for image processing and CAD evaluation for applications that include cancer screening, diagnosis, and image guided intervention, and treatment. Therefore, the NCI encourages investigator-initiated grant applications that utilize the database in their research. NCI also encourages investigator-initiated grant applications that provide tools or methodology that may improve or complement the mission of the LIDC.

__TCIA Collections__

Cancer imaging data sets across various cancer types (e.g. carcinoma, lung cancer, myeloma) and various imaging modalities.
The image data in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) is organized into purpose-built collections of subjects. The subjects typically have a cancer type and/or anatomical site (lung, brain, etc.) in common. Each link in the table below contains information concerning the scientific value of a collection, information about how to obtain any supporting non-image data which may be available, and links to view or download the imaging data. To support reproducibility in scientific research, TCIA supports Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) which allow users to share subsets of TCIA data referenced in a research manuscript.

__Belarus tuberculosis portal__

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major problem of Belarus Public Health .Recently situation has been complicated with emergence and development of MDR/XDR TB and HIV/TB which require long-term treatment. Many and the most severe cases usually disseminate across the country to different TB dispensaries. The ability of leading Belarus TB specialists to follow such patients will be greatly improved by using a common database containing patients’ radiological images, lab work and clinical data. This will also significantly improve adherence to the treatment protocol and result in a better record of the treatment outcomes.
Criteria for inclusion clinical cases in the database of the portal - patients admitted to the MDR-TB department of RSPC of Pulmonology and Tuberculosis with diagnosed or suspected of MDR-TB, which conducted CT – study (± 2 months from the date of registration)
Belarus dataset have both chest X-rays and CT scans of the same patient.

__DDSM: Digital Database for Screening Mammography__

 The Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) is a resource for use by the mammographic image analysis research community. Primary support for this project was a grant from the Breast Cancer Research Program of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command. The DDSM project is a collaborative effort involving co-p.i.s at the Massachusetts General Hospital (D. Kopans, R. Moore), the University of South Florida (K. Bowyer), and Sandia National Laboratories (P. Kegelmeyer). Additional cases from Washington University School of Medicine were provided by Peter E. Shile, MD, Assistant Professor of Radiology and Internal Medicine. Additional collaborating institutions include Wake Forest University School of Medicine (Departments of Medical Engineering and Radiology), Sacred Heart Hospital and ISMD, Incorporated. The primary purpose of the database is to facilitate sound research in the development of computer algorithms to aid in screening. Secondary purposes of the database may include the development of algorithms to aid in the diagnosis and the development of teaching or training aids. The database contains approximately 2,500 studies. Each study includes two images of each breast, along with some associated patient information (age at time of study, ACR breast density rating, subtlety rating for abnormalities, ACR keyword description of abnormalities) and image information (scanner, spatial resolution, ...). Images containing suspicious areas have associated pixel-level "ground truth" information about the locations and types of suspicious regions. Also provided are software both for accessing the mammogram and truth images and for calculating performance figures for automated image analysis algorithms.

__Prostate__

Prostate cancer (CaP) has been reported on a worldwide scale to be the second most frequently diagnosed cancer of men accounting for 13.6% (Ferlay et al. (2010)). Statistically, in 2008, the number of new diagnosed cases was estimated to be 899, 000 with no less than 258, 100 deaths (Ferlay et al. (2010)).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides imaging techniques allowing to diagnose and localize CaP. The I2CVB provides a multi-parametric MRI dataset to help at the development of computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) system.

__SCR database: Segmentation in Chest Radiographs__


The automatic segmentation of anatomical structures in chest radiographs is of great importance for computer-aided diagnosis in these images. The SCR database has been established to facilitate comparative studies on segmentation of the lung fields, the heart and the clavicles in standard posterior-anterior chest radiographs.

In the spirit of cooperative scientific progress, we freely share the SCR database and are committed to maintaining a public repository of results of various algorithms on these segmentation tasks. On thes pages, instructions can be found on downloading the database and uploading results, and benchmark results of various methods can be inspected.
