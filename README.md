__Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC)__


Preliminary clinical studies have shown that spiral CT scanning of the lungs can improve early detection of lung cancer in high-risk individuals. Image processing algorithms have the potential to assist in lesion detection on spiral CT studies, and to assess the stability or change in lesion size on serial CT studies. The use of such computer-assisted algorithms could significantly enhance the sensitivity and specificity of spiral CT lung screening, as well as lower costs by reducing physician time needed for interpretation.

The intent of the Lung Imaging Database Consortium (LIDC) initiative was to support a consortium of institutions to develop consensus guidelines for a spiral CT lung image resource and to construct a database of spiral CT lung images. The investigators funded under this initiative created a set of guidelines and metrics for database use and for developing a database as a test-bed and showcase for those methods. The database is available to researchers and users through the Internet and has wide utility as a research, teaching, and training resource.

Specifically, the LIDC initiative aims were to provide:

*	a reference database for the relative evaluation of image processing or CAD algorithms and
*	a flexible query system that will provide investigators the opportunity to evaluate a wide range of technical parameters and de-identified clinical information within this database that may be important for research applications.

This resource will stimulate further database development for image processing and CAD evaluation for applications that include cancer screening, diagnosis, and image guided intervention, and treatment. Therefore, the NCI encourages investigator-initiated grant applications that utilize the database in their research. NCI also encourages investigator-initiated grant applications that provide tools or methodology that may improve or complement the mission of the LIDC.

__Belarus tuberculosis portal__

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major problem of Belarus Public Health. Recently situation has been complicated with emergence and development of MDR/XDR TB and HIV/TB which require long-term treatment. Many and the most severe cases usually disseminate across the country to different TB dispensaries. The ability of leading Belarus TB specialists to follow such patients will be greatly improved by using a common database containing patients’ radiological images, lab work and clinical data. This will also significantly improve adherence to the treatment protocol and result in a better record of the treatment outcomes.
Criteria for inclusion clinical cases in the database of the portal - patients admitted to the MDR-TB department of RSPC of Pulmonology and Tuberculosis with diagnosed or suspected of MDR-TB, which conducted CT – study (± 2 months from the date of registration)
Belarus dataset have both chest X-rays and CT scans of the same patient.

__DDSM: Digital Database for Screening Mammography__

 The Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) is a resource for use by the mammographic image analysis research community. Primary support for this project was a grant from the Breast Cancer Research Program of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command. The DDSM project is a collaborative effort involving co-p.i.s at the Massachusetts General Hospital (D. Kopans, R. Moore), the University of South Florida (K. Bowyer), and Sandia National Laboratories (P. Kegelmeyer). Additional cases from Washington University School of Medicine were provided by Peter E. Shile, MD, Assistant Professor of Radiology and Internal Medicine. Additional collaborating institutions include Wake Forest University School of Medicine (Departments of Medical Engineering and Radiology), Sacred Heart Hospital and ISMD, Incorporated. The primary purpose of the database is to facilitate sound research in the development of computer algorithms to aid in screening. Secondary purposes of the database may include the development of algorithms to aid in the diagnosis and the development of teaching or training aids. The database contains approximately 2,500 studies. Each study includes two images of each breast, along with some associated patient information (age at time of study, ACR breast density rating, subtlety rating for abnormalities, ACR keyword description of abnormalities) and image information (scanner, spatial resolution, ...). Images containing suspicious areas have associated pixel-level "ground truth" information about the locations and types of suspicious regions. Also provided are software both for accessing the mammogram and truth images and for calculating performance figures for automated image analysis algorithms.

__mini-MIAS: MIAS MiniMammographic Database__

The Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) is an organisation of UK research groups interested in the understanding of mammograms and has generated a database of digital mammograms. Films taken from the UK National Breast Screening Programme have been digitised to 50 micron pixel edge with a Joyce-Loebl scanning microdensitometer, a device linear in the optical density range 0-3.2 and representing each pixel with an 8-bit word. The database contains 322 digitised films and is available on 2.3GB 8mm (ExaByte) tape. It also includes radiologist's "truth"-markings on the locations of any abnormalities that may be present. The database has been reduced to a 200 micron pixel edge and padded/clipped so that all the images are 1024x1024. Mammographic images are available via the Pilot European Image Processing Archive (PEIPA) at the University of Essex.

## 7. Medical Speech Data
__The TORGO Database: Acoustic and articulatory speech from speakers with dysarthria__  
The TORGO database of dysarthric articulation consists of aligned acoustics and measured 3D articulatory features from speakers with either cerebral palsy (CP) or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), which are two of the most prevalent causes of speech disability (Kent and Rosen, 2004), and matched controls. This database, called TORGO, is the result of a collaboration between the departments of Computer Science and Speech-Language Pathology at the University of Toronto and the Holland-Bloorview Kids Rehab hospital in Toronto.

__NKI-CCRT Corpus: Speech Intelligibility Before and After Advanced Head and Neck Cancer Treated with Concomitant Chemoradiotherapy.__  
 NKI-CCRT corpus with individual listener judgements on the intelligibility of recordings of 55 speakers treated for cancer of the head and neck will be made available for restricted scientific use. The corpus contains recordings and perceptual evaluations of speech intelligibility over three evaluation moments: before treatment and after treatment (10-weeks and 12-months). Treatment was by means of chemoradiotherapy (CCRT).

__Atypical Affect Interspeech Sub-Challenge__

  Björn Schuller, Simone Hantke, and colleagues are providing the EMOTASS Corpus. This unique corpus is the first to give access to recordings of affective speech from disabled individuals encompassing a broader variety of mental, neurological, and physical disabilities. It comprises recordings of 15 disabled adult individuals (ages range from 19 to 58 years with a mean age of 31.6 years). The task will be classification of five emotions from their speech facing atypical display. Recordings were made in their everyday working environment. Overall, around 11k utterances and around nine hours of speech are included.
